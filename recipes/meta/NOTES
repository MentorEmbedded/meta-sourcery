Open questions:
* Does it hurt anything to have the sysroot setup in -shared instead
  of only including it in eglibc-sourcery-prebuilt, cross-canadian,
  and toolchain-prebuilt? In particular, what happens with it for -cross
  and for eglibc-sourcery?

Where I'm at:

* Fix CSL_TARGET_CORE setting (or work around it)
