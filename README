meta-sourcery
=============

This layer provides support for using the Code Sourcery prebuilt binary
toolchains. The "README.md" file is the original README associated with
the upstream layer.

Dependencies
------------
This layer requires a prebuilt binary toolchain, and possibly also the
corresponding source. It also requires additional configuration, which
is provided in the wr-toolchain-shim layer in wrlinux.

Maintenance
-----------
This version of the layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes. It is based on the upstream
meta-sourcery layer:

Building the meta-sourcery layer
--------------------------------
The meta-sourcery layer is the default build option when using the
wrlinux configure wrapper. To use it directly, you must define a
few specific values, such as EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN. The exact details
will vary with the binary toolchain you're using it with.
